                <h1>ORIGIN OF THE WORD COCKTAIL</h1>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    There is debate about when the term was first used. According the
                    <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/travel/1256/the-surprising-history-of-the-cocktail.html">The London Telegraph</a>
                    , the word is first found in print in a March 20, 1798 satirical
                    newspaper article about what must have been a hell of a party. Of
                    particular note, was the account of drinks imbibed by William Pitt
                    (the younger) which included “L’huile de Venus,” “parfait amour,”
                    and “‘cock-tail (vulgarly called ginger.)'” Some challenge whether
                    “cocktail” in this article truly referred to an alcoholic drink, or
                    something else.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Others point to an April 28, 1803 article from The Farmer’s Cabinet
                    in Vermont, where to drink a cocktail was claimed to be “excellent
                    for the head.”
                </p>

                    <p class="pr-4 text-justify">
                        Regardless, certainly by 1806, the word was being used with its
                        current meaning. In the May 13th edition of the newspaper, Balance
                        and Columbian Repository, the editor defined a cocktail as:
                        <a href="http://www.chowhound.com/food-news/54845/whats-the-origin-of-the-word-cocktail/" class="text-warning">a stimulating liquor composed of spirits of any kinda sugar,
                            water, and bitters.</a>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p class="text-justify">
                    During the early 17th century, an animal, particularly a horse, with
                    a docked tail, was said to have a “cock tail.” By the 19th century,
                    unlike other horses, thoroughbreds did not have docked tails, so
                    when a regular horse was entered into a race, its cock tail was
                    noted – and became a term synonymous with an adulterated horse.
                    Since horse racing and liquor go together like peaches and cream,
                    this theory holds that the word “cock tail” was soon used to mean an
                    adulterated spirit.
                </p>

                <p class="text-justify">
                    A second theory holds that the name is derived from the term “cock
                    tailings,” the result of the practice of tavern owners combining the
                    dregs (tailings) of nearly empty barrels together into a single
                    elixir that was sold at bargain prices. This only makes sense when
                    you know that the spigot of a barrel was sometimes referred to as a
                    “cock.”
